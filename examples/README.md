  Agents, patterns, and applications you can build with Deep Agents.
</p>

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [deep_research](deep_research/) | Multi-step web research agent using Tavily for URL discovery, parallel sub-agents, and strategic reflection |
| [content-builder-agent](content-builder-agent/) | Content writing agent that demonstrates memory (`AGENTS.md`), skills, and subagents for blog posts, LinkedIn posts, and tweets with generated images |
| [text-to-sql-agent](text-to-sql-agent/) | Natural language to SQL agent with planning, skill-based workflows, and the Chinook demo database |
| [ralph_mode](ralph_mode/) | Autonomous looping pattern that runs with fresh context each iteration, using the filesystem for persistence |
| [downloading_agents](downloading_agents/) | Shows how agents are just folders—download a zip, unzip, and run |

Each example has its own README with setup instructions.

## Contributing an Example

When adding a new example:

- **Use uv** for dependency management with a `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
- **Pin to deepagents version** - use a specific version or version range in dependencies
- **Include a README** with clear setup and usage instructions
- **Add tests** if the example has non-trivial logic
- **Keep it focused** - each example should demonstrate one concept or use-case
- **Follow the structure** of existing examples (see `deep_research/` or `text-to-sql-agent/` as references)
