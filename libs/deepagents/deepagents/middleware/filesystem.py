READ_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Reads a file from the filesystem.

Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- By default, it reads up to 100 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
  - First scan: read_file(path, limit=100) to see file structure
  - Read more sections: read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
  - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(path, offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Lines longer than 5,000 characters will be split into multiple lines with continuation markers (e.g., 5.1, 5.2, etc.). When you specify a limit, these continuation lines count towards the limit.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are returned as multimodal image content blocks (see https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal).

For image tasks:
- Use `read_file(file_path=...)` for `.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.webp`
- Do NOT use `offset`/`limit` for images (pagination is text-only)
- If image details were compacted from history, call `read_file` again on the same path

- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it."""

EDIT_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must read the file before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.
- When editing, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) from the read output. Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it."""

Examples:
- `**/*.py` - Find all Python files
- `*.txt` - Find all text files in root
- `/subdir/**/*.md` - Find all markdown files under /subdir"""

GREP_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Search for a text pattern across files.

Searches for literal text (not regex) and returns matching files or content based on output_mode.
Special characters like parentheses, brackets, pipes, etc. are treated as literal characters, not regex operators.

Examples:
- Search all files: `grep(pattern="TODO")`
- Search Python files only: `grep(pattern="import", glob="*.py")`
- Show matching lines: `grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")`
- Search for code with special chars: `grep(pattern="def __init__(self):")`"""

EXECUTE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Executes a shell command in an isolated sandbox environment.

Usage:
Executes a given command in the sandbox environment with proper handling and security measures.
Before executing the command, please follow these steps:
1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the ls tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory
2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Examples of proper quoting:
     - cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
     - python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command
   - Capture the output of the command
Usage notes:
  - Commands run in an isolated sandbox environment
  - Returns combined stdout/stderr output with exit code
  - If the output is very large, it may be truncated
  - For long-running commands, use the optional timeout parameter to override the default timeout (e.g., execute(command="make build", timeout=300))
  - A timeout of 0 may disable timeouts on backends that support no-timeout execution
  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like find and grep. Instead use the grep, glob tools to search. You MUST avoid read tools like cat, head, tail, and use read_file to read files.
  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings)
    - Use '&&' when commands depend on each other (e.g., "mkdir dir && cd dir")
    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd

Examples:
  Good examples:
    - execute(command="pytest /foo/bar/tests")
    - execute(command="python /path/to/script.py")
    - execute(command="npm install && npm test")
    - execute(command="make build", timeout=300)

  Bad examples (avoid these):
    - execute(command="cd /foo/bar && pytest tests")  # Use absolute path instead
    - execute(command="cat file.txt")  # Use read_file tool instead
    - execute(command="find . -name '*.py'")  # Use glob tool instead
    - execute(command="grep -r 'pattern' .")  # Use grep tool instead

Note: This tool is only available if the backend supports execution (SandboxBackendProtocol).
If execution is not supported, the tool will return an error message."""

- Read files before editing — understand existing content before making changes
- Mimic existing style, naming conventions, and patterns

## Filesystem Tools `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`

You have access to a filesystem which you can interact with using these tools.
All file paths must start with a /. Follow the tool docs for the available tools, and use pagination (offset/limit) when reading large files.

- ls: list files in a directory (requires absolute path)
- read_file: read a file from the filesystem
- write_file: write to a file in the filesystem
- edit_file: edit a file in the filesystem
- glob: find files matching a pattern (e.g., "**/*.py")
- grep: search for text within files

## Large Tool Results

When a tool result is too large, it may be offloaded into the filesystem instead of being returned inline. In those cases, use `read_file` to inspect the saved result in chunks, or use `grep` within `/large_tool_results/` if you need to search across offloaded tool results and do not know the exact file path. Offloaded tool results are stored under `/large_tool_results/<tool_call_id>`."""

# Tools that should be excluded from the large result eviction logic.
#
# This tuple contains tools that should NOT have their results evicted to the filesystem
# when they exceed token limits. Tools are excluded for different reasons:
#
# 1. Tools with built-in truncation (ls, glob, grep):
#    These tools truncate their own output when it becomes too large. When these tools
#    produce truncated output due to many matches, it typically indicates the query
#    needs refinement rather than full result preservation. In such cases, the truncated
#    matches are potentially more like noise and the LLM should be prompted to narrow
#    its search criteria instead.
#
# 2. Tools with problematic truncation behavior (read_file):
#    read_file is tricky to handle as the failure mode here is single long lines
#    (e.g., imagine a jsonl file with very long payloads on each line). If we try to
#    truncate the result of read_file, the agent may then attempt to re-read the
#    truncated file using read_file again, which won't help.
#
# 3. Tools that never exceed limits (edit_file, write_file):
#    These tools return minimal confirmation messages and are never expected to produce
#    output large enough to exceed token limits, so checking them would be unnecessary.
