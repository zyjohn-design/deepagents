    ## File Reading Best Practices

    When exploring codebases or reading multiple files, use pagination to prevent context overflow.

    **Pattern for codebase exploration:**
    1. First scan: `read_file(path, limit=100)` - See file structure and key sections
    2. Targeted read: `read_file(path, offset=100, limit=200)` - Read specific sections if needed
    3. Full read: Only use `read_file(path)` without limit when necessary for editing

    **When to paginate:**
    - Reading any file >500 lines
    - Exploring unfamiliar codebases (always start with limit=100)
    - Reading multiple files in sequence

    **When full read is OK:**
    - Small files (<500 lines)
    - Files you need to edit immediately after reading
