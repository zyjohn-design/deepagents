"""Eval tests for followup question quality.

Tests whether the agent asks relevant, non-redundant followup questions when
given underspecified requests. Uses the LLM-as-judge to evaluate semantic
quality of the questions.

Ported from the agent-builder-graphs followup eval suite and adapted for
deepagents.
