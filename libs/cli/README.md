## Quick Install

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/main/libs/cli/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
# With model provider extras (OpenAI is included by default)
DEEPAGENTS_EXTRAS="anthropic,groq" curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/main/libs/cli/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or install directly with `uv`:

```bash
# Install with chosen model providers (OpenAI is included by default)
uv tool install 'deepagents-cli[anthropic,groq]'
```

Run the CLI:

```bash
deepagents
```

## 🤔 What is this?

The fastest way to start using Deep Agents. `deepagents-cli` is a pre-built coding agent in your terminal — similar to Claude Code or Cursor — powered by any LLM that supports tool calling. One install command and you're up and running, no code required.

**What the CLI adds on top of the SDK:**

- **Interactive TUI** — rich terminal interface with streaming responses
- **Conversation resume** — pick up where you left off across sessions
- **Web search** — ground responses in live information
- **Remote sandboxes** — run code in isolated environments (Modal, Runloop, Daytona, & more)
- **Persistent memory** — agent remembers context across conversations
- **Custom skills** — extend the agent with your own slash commands
- **Headless mode** — run non-interactively for scripting and CI
- **Human-in-the-loop** — approve or reject tool calls before execution

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

This project was primarily inspired by Claude Code, and initially was largely an attempt to see what made Claude Code general purpose, and make it even more so.
